## 🚀 Project Overview

EcoFlowIoT is an IoT-powered solution designed to monitor the real-time fill levels of dustbins. Using IR sensors and Firebase Realtime Database, this system allows users to track bin statuses (Low, Medium, High, Full) on a sleek web dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was developed as part of an exploration lab initiative where hardware and software teams collaborated to integrate live data with a dynamic frontend interface.
